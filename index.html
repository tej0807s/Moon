        <p>
            The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the
            width of Australia),it is the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its
            planet,the fifth largest satellite in the Solar System overall, and is larger than any known dwarf planet.
            Orbiting Earth at an average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi),or about 30 times Earth's diameter, its
            gravitational influence slightly lengthens Earth's day and is the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon is
            classified as a planetary-mass object and a differentiated rocky body, and lacks any significant atmosphere,
            hydrosphere, or magnetic field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's (0.1654 g); Jupiter's moon
            Io is the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density.

        <p>
            Chandrayaan-2 is the second lunar exploration mission developed by the Indian Space Research Organisation
            (ISRO), after Chandrayaan-1. It consists of a lunar orbiter, and also included the Vikram lander, and the
            Pragyan lunar rover, all of which were developed in India. The main scientific objective is to map and study
            the variations in lunar surface composition, as well as the location and abundance of lunar water.The
            spacecraft was launched on its mission to the Moon from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space
            Centre in Andhra Pradesh on 22 July 2019 at 09:13:12 UTC by a GSLV Mark III-M1. The craft reached the Moon's
            orbit on 20 August 2019 and began orbital positioning manoeuvres for the landing of the Vikram lander.

            Chandrayaan 2 Orbiter is capable of communicating with Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu as well
            as the Vikram Lander. The precise launch and mission management has ensured a mission life of almost seven
            years instead of the planned one year. <br>

            Lander — Vikram:
            The Lander of Chandrayaan-2 was named Vikram after Dr Vikram A Sarabhai, the Father of the Indian Space
            Programme. It was designed to function for one lunar day, which is equivalent to about 14 Earth days. <br>

            Rover — Pragyan:
            Chandrayaan-2’s Rover was a 6-wheeled robotic vehicle named as Pragyan, which translates to 'wisdom' in
            Sanskrit.

        <p>
            GSLV MkIII, chosen to launch Chandrayaan-2 spacecraft, is a three-stage heavy lift launch vehicle developed
            by ISRO. The vehicle has two solid strap-ons, a core liquid booster and a cryogenic upper stage.GSLV Mk III
            is designed to carry 4 ton class of satellites into Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) or about 10 tons to
            Low Earth Orbit (LEO), which is about twice the capability of the GSLV Mk II.The two strap-on motors of GSLV
            Mk III are located on either side of its core liquid booster. Designated as ‘S200’, each carries 205 tons of
            composite solid propellant and their ignition results in vehicle lift-off. S200s function for 140 seconds.
            During strap-ons functioning phase, the two clustered Vikas liquid Engines of L110 liquid core booster will
            ignite 114 sec after lift -off to further augment the thrust of the vehicle. These two engines continue to
            function after the separation of the strap-ons at about 140 seconds after lift -off.
